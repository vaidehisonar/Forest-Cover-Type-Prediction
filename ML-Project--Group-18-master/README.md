# ML-Project--Group-18

Performed dimensionality reduction and feature selection to improve the accuracy of the forest cover type prediction. For feature selection an algorithm Maximum Spearman Minimum Covariance Cuckoo Search(MSMCCS) was used. Bagging was done for PCA and LassoCV. 
Predictive modelling was done by using models like K-NN, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression and a Voting Classifier. The features selected by MSMCCS algorithm, on which the Voting classifier was applied, gave the best accuracy.
